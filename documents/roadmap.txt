- PDO driver
- dbFacile:$instances to hold multiple instances
- prepare core and driver classes for pulling schemas and foreign keys
- cache schemas in some public static data structure
	- include tables, fields, types, primary keys, foreign keys
- reject invalid fields in insert() and update()
- PostgreSQL
- MSSQL
- MySqli
- quote table and field names in single-quotes or backticks


FROM FUTURE FILE

- quote all table and field references in single-quotes or backticks, whichever is appropriate for connected DB
- table prefix to prepend to all tables (except for hand-typed queries)? might be too much work
- getTables()
- error out if don't have dbHandle
- add static method to base class for instantiating driver classes. allows for more streamlined integration into ecommerce: call to base class should trigger __autoload which can load the file called dbFacile.php rather than trying to load dbFacile_mysql.php
- check for valid tables passed to insert(), update(), delete()

- return generated primary key on insert for mssql
	- possibly use information_schema
	- use scope_identity() ... needs testing
	- http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190315.aspx
- fetchRow to use limit for some DBs?
- PDO for sqlite3
- mssql table info

BAD IDEAS

- fetchColumn implodes all columns in query and then appends to value array
